Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 4.11](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.11)!

## Deploy keys support

GitBucket now supports deploy keys. You can register a public key to the repository and access to the repository via SSH using that key.

This allows Jenkins or other tools to read (and write if necessary) the repository without a dedicated account.

## Collaborator of the private forked repository

When you fork a private repository, the forked repository takes over collaborators of the original repository since this version.

It allows the owner or collaborators of the original repository to access to forked private repositories in the default configuration. Of course, you can remove or add collaborators after forking the repository as usual.

## Cache avatar images in the browser

Uploaded avatar images are now cached in the browser because GitBucket has added some headers to the response.

In addition, GitBucket has added the hash value calculated from the startup timestamp to assets automatically like:

```html
<link href="http://localhost:8080/assets/vendors/bootstrap-3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css?20170321132510" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="http://localhost:8080/assets/vendors/octicons-4.2.0/octicons.css?20170321132510" rel="stylesheet">
...
```

This makes sure to reload assets when they are updated.

## Repository event hook

Added new extension point for plug-ins to hook events about repository.

Extend [RepositoryHook](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/blob/master/src/main/scala/gitbucket/core/plugin/RepositoryHook.scala) and register it in `Plugins` to handle repository events in your plug-in. `RepositoryHook` has following methods corresponding to the event, so override you want to handle.

- created
- deleted
- renamed
- transferred
- forked

In addition, this release contains some improvements and bug fixes such as

- GitHub API compatibility is further improved for Jenkins integration.
- Fix broken layout in some pages
- Avoid HTTP request to external services in default
- Makes possible to compile with Java9

See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.11) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
