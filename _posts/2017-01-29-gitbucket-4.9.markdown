Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 4.9](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.9)!

## GitLFS support

Experimental suppoort of GitLFS is now available.

You have to fill the base url of your GitBucket instance at the system settings page to enable GitLFS support.

Itâ€™s all. Now you can use GitLFS on GitBucket. Large files are stored under `GITBUCKET_HOME/repositories/<user>/<repository>/lfs`. At the blob view of the repository viewer, LFS badge is shown for LFS files as following:

We are planning an option to store large files to the storage other than local file system such as the distributed file system or the cloud storage.

## Template for issues and pull requests

It's possible to define a template of issues and pull requests by adding a file called `ISSUES_TEMPLATE` to the root directory of your git repository. A defined template is shown as a initial value of the description of new issue or pull request.

## Manual label color editing

Color of issues and pull request labels is now editable by color code directly.
